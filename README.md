# Car-Detection-using-YOLO-ALgorithm
The first step in building a self-driving car system is to build a car detection system.

In this project, I have used the YOLO algorithm to build a Car Detection system.
YOLO (You only look once) is a popular algorithm because it gives a higher accuracy while being able to run in real-time. "Only looks once" means that it requires only one forward propagation pass through the network to make predictions. After non-max suppression, it then outputs recognized objects together with the bounding boxes.
